            <li>Ground Turmeric <em>or</em> Saffron threads</li>

        <h2>Steps:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Brown the chicken</strong></li>
            <p>After patting the 2 pounds of boneless, skinless chicken thighs dry, season both sides with kosher salt and black pepper. Heat 2 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil in a pan over medium-high heat, and sear the chicken on both sides. Remove from the pan and set aside.</p>
            <li><strong>Cook the chicken</strong></li>
            <p>Drizzle more extra virgin olive oil if necessary, and add 1 sliced onion and 2 cloves minced garlic. Season with kosher salt and cook until the onion has softened. Pour in ¾ cup water and all the spices. Once the mixture is boiling, return the chicken to the pan and cook until the chicken is fully cooked. (Cooked chicken will have an internal temperature of 165 degrees F when using a meat thermometer.) The liquid should be reduced by half as well. Remove the chicken from the pan and leave the liquid in the pan – do not discard it.</p>
            <li><strong>Shred the chicken</strong></li>
            <p>Carefully shred the chicken into pieces. It will be very hot, so I advise using a fork and knife or two forks. Don’t use your fingers.</p>
            <li><strong>Add the eggs</strong></li>
            <p>To the pan of liquid, gently stir in the 3 beaten eggs. The mixture might start looking a bit like scrambled eggs. That’s normal. Add the chicken back to the pan. Stir in the chopped dates, toasted almonds, and fresh parsley, and remove from the heat. Your Moroccan pastilla filling is ready!</p>
            <li><strong>Arrange the phyllo dough in the skillet</strong></li>
            <p>rush the bottom and sides of a 10-inch pie dish or heat-safe skillet with extra virgin olive oil. I used a well-seasoned cast-iron skillet. Fold one sheet of phyllo dough vertically (the long way) and brush the top with extra virgin olive oil. Lay the folded phyllo in the middle of the pan with the ends hanging over either side of the pan. Repeat this step with 7 more sheets of phyllo dough. Don’t forget to fold each one in half and to brush with extra virgin olive oil! Layer the phyllo sheets so that they overlap. To make it easier, rotate the pan a little each time you add a layer of phyllo to ensure that the phyllo covers the bottom of the pan completely. There should be phyllo pastry hanging slack all around the pan or skillet.</p>
            <li><strong>Add the chicken mixture to the skillet</strong></li>
            <p>Spoon the chicken mixture over the layered phyllo pastry. Cover with the last 2 sheets of phyllo, making sure to brush each one with extra virgin olive oil.</p>
            <p>Fold the hanging phyllo pieces over to cover. It might not look very neat, but that’s okay. This is a more rustic Moroccan pastilla. Brush the top with extra virgin olive oil.</p>
            <li><strong>Bake the pie</strong></li>
            <p>On the center rack of a 375 degrees F heated oven, bake the pie for 15 to 20 minutes or until the phyllo is fully cooked and golden brown. To ensure even color on all sides, rotate the pan a few times while the Moroccan bastilla cooks. Remove and use a sieve to sprinkle some powdered sugar over the top of the pie. Serve immediately.</p>
